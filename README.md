# NoteDictate
WatchOS 4 app

This is a WatchOS 4 application which is like our Notes app on the AppStore except for it doesn't take input in form of text but it takes voice inputs and converts
it into text and stores it for future references. It can run only on physical devices as dictation is not supported in the WatchKit Simulator.
